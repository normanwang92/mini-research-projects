## Q1

Build a Shiny web application that inputs

1. one stock ticker (query_stock)
  
2. time period [start_date, end_date], 
  
and outputs

1. a candlestick chart of query_stock in the given time period.
  
2. a list of five stocks with the highest return correlation over the period as its peers
  
3. historical pairwise correlations among the peers and query_stock
  
  The app should be able to support query_stock and peers in current S&P500 index universe.
  

## Q2

Build model(s) to explain contemporaneous return r_{i,t} of the stock i at time t. You can choose any stock within current S&P 500 universe. You are tested on your research methodology, not on any particular conclusion of your research.
You may use any contemporaneous cross section, time series, as well as historical panel information.
